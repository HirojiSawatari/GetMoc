GetMoc
======
This project can get the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) from MASK (Output data from CESM 1.0.3) and calculate the annual mean series of MOC. I use it to calculate the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).

The FORTRAN project isn't mine, I add it in this project only for test the output data of ncl project.
